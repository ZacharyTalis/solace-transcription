# On completion of all goals
[Dialogue from Solace follows.]
Congrats [email address without domain]! You've completed all of your goals!!  
You may have more goals to complete, and you can add more to your Solace account. It also may be time to say goodbye to Solace as you've done everything you wanted.  
Either way, I'll still be here if you need me. I'm not going anywhere. Above all else, I am so proud of you. I'm sure your journey has been challenging in different ways, yet you overcame them. You've had the audacity to exist in plain sight and to succeed against all odds.  
Whatever you take on next, know that you are capable and you can do it. Go get it friend.
