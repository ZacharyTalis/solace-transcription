# Updating Name/Gender Marker on New York State ID
Specific laws vary state-by-state, but I've got the steps to update your New York state ID here.
NOTE: The Sylvia Rivera Law Project provides a guide for New York residents to update their name and gender marker on legal ID, which can be found here: [https://srlp.org/resources/changeid](https://srlp.org/resources/changeid) For New York City residents, it also includes instructions to update an NYC municipal ID. Otherwise, the instructions for updating a driver's license or non-license state ID can be found below.  
In order to update your name and gender marker on your driver's license or state ID, you will need to first update your name with the Social Security Administration. Then, visit a Department of Motor Vehicles office with the following documents:

> Application for Permit, Driver's License or Non-Driver ID Card: [https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/mv44.pdf](https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/mv44.pdf)  
> Certified copy of court order for legal name change  
> Proof to support a change of gender marker  
    - This can be a "written statement from a physician, psychologist, psychiatrist or other appropriate professional that is printer on letterhead. The statement must certify that on gender is your main gender and that you identify as male or female. An appropriate professional can include but is not limited to a Life Counselor, a Clinical Social Worker or other professional who is overseeing the change in gender."1 [sic]  
> Appropriate fees ($12.50 for amended driver's license, $5 for non-driver's license ID)  
> Proof of ID, if you are upgrading to a READ ID (more info can be found here: [https://process.dmv.ny.gov/documentguide/dmv_license/DisplayPages/pwizlicensePermitNDID.cfm](https://process.dmv.ny.gov/documentguide/dmv_license/DisplayPages/pwizlicensePermitNDID.cfm))
