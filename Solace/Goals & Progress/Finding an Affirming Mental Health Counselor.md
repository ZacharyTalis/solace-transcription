# Finding an Affirming Mental Health Counselor
Transition can be a difficult process. Having someone to talk to can make it a little easier.  
A professional counselor can be many things to different people, but briefly but, they are a qualified mental health professional who can help you work through life problems and identify mental health issues by talking about your mood feeling, thoughts, and behaviors, and can help you to develop healthy coping mechanism for those issues. Counseling is designed to improve overall feeling of well-being, resolve crises, and alleviate distress. When it comes to transition, a licensed counselor can also provide letters of support for medical treatment and updating legal ID documents.  
The field of counseling psychology overlaps with psychotherapy, which is a field of talk therapy designed to understand and manage symptoms for a broad array of mental health ailments, including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. However, this resource will focus on counseling as a way of coping with life stressors, including discrimination or harassment. For management of diagnosed mental health conditions, see the related resource "Seeking Treatment for Mental Health Issues."  
Some of the problems that can be address via counseling psychology can include:

> Work/school stress  
> Relationship difficulties  
> Coping with negative life events and managing stress  
> Organizational problems  
> Dealing with and adjusting to physical disabilities, disease, or injury  
> Personal/social adjustment  
> Identity development  
> Difficulties relating to others  
> Identifying mental health conditions  

Counseling may take place in an individual or group setting, depending on the counselor and your individual needs. While many people do find relief in seeing a mental health professional, know that it is not a requirement for your transition or any other aspect of your mental and emotional well-being. People who see a counselor are sometimes tempted to promote it as a catch-all remedy for any kind of distress, but only you can know whether it's right for you. At the same time, if this is something you have been considering or think might be beneficial to you, the only way to know for sure is to make an appointment.  
Finding a good counselor can be a complicated task that requires a lot of time and patience. Like any healthcare provider, there is no guarantee that a person's credentials makes [sic] them a good match for you.  This is doubly true when speaking of mental health professionals, as the relationship you have with your counselor depends in large part on how your personalities mesh or clash.  
Resources like Psychology Today are a great starting point to find an affirming and competent counselor: [www.psychologytoday.com/us](www.psychologytoday.com/us). There you can search providers in your area, narrow by their credentials, accepted insurance, therapeutic techniques, and specialization. A word of caution, though. There is a big different between a provider listing gender identity and transgender issues as something they feel competent to work with (listed under "issues"), versus listing it as a focus of their practice (listed under "specialties"). One red flag to look for is anyone who associates gender identity with sex and sexuality in their narrative. Psychology Today does not check the accuracy of the information that mental health professionals put in their database and they can not guarantee any level of care from any of the providers on their rosters.  
Another place to check is the WPATH provider directory: [www.wpath.org/provider/search](www.wpath.org/provider/search). They maintain a list of providers for all trans health related fields, which you can search by location and specialty. While the WPATH list is fairly expansive, and all the professionals on it have had some level of training in WPATH standards of care, like Psychology Today it is not a vetted list.  
Your first appointment with a counselor should be more like an interview; they are getting some basic information about you and your needs, and you are discovering if this is a person with whom you feel you can develop a working rapport. In your first meeting or phone call, it's good to get them answering a few of your questions, to see if they're a good fit for you. Some of the questions to ask are:

1. Are you LGBTQ affirming?  
2. Have you ever worked with transgender clients before?  
3. Have you ever written letters to support gender transition?  
4. What will you need to feel comfortable writing a letter for medical transition? Will I be able to read the letter before it is sent?  
5. Are you affiliated with WPATH and versed in its standards of care? 
6. How do you support and advocate for your transgender patients?  
7. How long and often will my sessions be?  
8. What is your hourly rate, and do you accept insurance?  
9. Do you lead transgender group sessions, and who is allowed to attend?

One you choose a counselor and start attending sessions, you will hopefully begin to build a rapport with them. If it doesn't happen quickly, don't get discouraged. Working with a new counselor is a little like becoming friends with someone. It can take time for things to "click." If after several sessions, you still feel that you're not comfortable with your counselor, or that there is no ease between you, discuss it with them. It may be they are not the right person for you. Ask for recommendations for other counselors who may be a better fit. Don't feel you are stuck with one person. And again, don't feel pressured to continue counseling if you don't feel like it's providing a benefit. Despite how commonplace it has been among younger people (both within and outside of this community), counseling is not the only pathway for managing your mental and emotional health, and it is not for everyone.  
[Bliss butterfly icon.] Counselors can help with emotional health, but cannot prescribe or diagnose for mental health illnesses. There are both app based and in-person counselors available, and most accept some form of insurance. Goal amounts are for one (1) sessions.
