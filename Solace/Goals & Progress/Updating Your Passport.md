# Updating Your Passport
Ooh, where are we going?  
To update the gender marker (referred to on the passport as a sex marker) on your US passport, fill out a new application for a US Passport (Form DS-11, available at [https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/forms.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/forms.html)). If you have already had appropriate clinical treatment for gender transition to male or female, as determined by a physician, your new passport will be valid for 10 years (for adults - updated passports for children under the age of 16 are valid for 5 years). Otherwise, if your medical certification indicates that you are still in the process of transitioning, the passport will be valid for 2 years. The medical certification can come from the physician who has treated you, or one who has reviewed and evaluated your medical history. The State Department does not have any criteria for specific treatments or surgeries that must be completed as "appropriate clinical treatment", so this will be largely up to the discretion of the reviewing provider. It will be important to first have a conversation with that provider about where you feel you are at in your transition and any plans for future treatment, to help ensure that their certification is accurate to your needs.  
You will need to submit the following documentation with your application:

1. Photocopy of evidence of US Citizenship, such as any one of the following:  
    1a. Fully valid, undamaged US passport (current or expired)  
    1b. US birth certificate
