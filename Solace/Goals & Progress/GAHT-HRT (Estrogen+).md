# GAHT/HRT (Estrogen+)
This can be an intimidating process, but I've got you covered.  
NOTE: Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is a term which more accurately describes the use of hormones by the trans community versus hormone replacement therapy (HRT). You may encounter both terms interchangeably when seeking out gender-affirming care, but this resource uses GAHT as the more current and medically-accurate term.  
For patients seeking to begin GAHT, a small but growing number of informed consent (IC) clinics allow patients to start treatment without the requirements discussed below. Typically, this entails an office visit to discuss treatment options and effects, and determine that the patient is able to provide informed consent for treatment. A link to a map of known IC clinics (credit to ShareBlue digital director Erin Reed) can be found here: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&ll=46.1509178489253%2C-115.16746627527243&z=7](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&ll=46.1509178489253%2C-115.16746627527243&z=7).  
Aside from this option, most other physicians in the US and worldwide follow the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care (SOC). Their criteria for beginning GAHT are listed below:

> Persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria  
> Capacity to make a fully informed decision and to consent to treatment  
> Age of majority in a given country  
> If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well-controlled.

Assessment for these criteria must be done by a qualified health professional, either a mental health professional like a therapist, or, if they are qualified to perform this assessment, a hormone provider (some primary care providers can do this, otherwise this would be a specialist like an endocrinologist). If a mental health professional completes the assessment, they must be the one to refer you to the provider for GAHT. If you are being referred by a therapist for treatment, they may be able to assist with connecting you to a provider. A primary care physician (PCP) may not be able to complete the assessment or start treatment themselves, but can also initiate a specialist referral to a healthcare provider who can. Otherwise, a search engine inquiry for "[city name] hormone therapy" will also give you a starting point in terms of who in your area offers those services.  
The goal of GAHT is to reduce the body's level of testosterone and increase estrogen in order to encourage physical changes in the body. This is typically done through a combination of hormone treatments. The prescription, dosage, and method of delivery will depend on your desired outcome from treatment (full feminization vs. androgynous presentation), so it is critical to be open and direct with your healthcare provider regarding your goals so they can prescribe appropriately. Depending on the care plan that you develop with your provider, you may start taking testosterone blockers prior to estrogen, or begin both treatments concurrently.  
Testosterone blockers, also referred to as anti-androgens, block the effect of testosterone on the body by blocking receptors or can be taken orally, as an injection, or as an implant. The hormone estradiol is used to boost estrogen production, reduce the production of testosterone, and promote feminine physical changes in the body. Estradiol can be taken orally, as an injection or as a gel, cream, or spray.  
While everyone is different, typical outcomes with GAHT include a decrease in sexual function, slowing of baldness, softer skin, decrease in testicular size, development of breasts, change in body fat distribution, and change in hair texture. Some of the risks of beginning GAHT include either increased or reduced blood pressure, decreased fertility, increased urination, high potassium, increased risk of blood clots, high triglycerides, and heart disease or stroke, especially if you are older than 50 years of age. If you are experiencing any unusual symptoms, communicate these to your provider so they can modify doses or discuss alternative treatment options with you.  
Costs can vary depending on the clinic, prescribed treatment, and patient's insurance coverage. With a GoodRx coupon, testosterone generally costs between  $12 to $60 a month, depending on your dose and route. For patients with insurance, make sure that the endocrinologist is in-network for your plan (this can be verified by calling your insurance, or most have a provider lookup tool on their website for members). If possible, see if the clinic can give you a quote or even the procedure codes that they bill under. The bulk of your costs will fall under specialty office visits and prescription coverage, so be sure to verify your coverage level for these services. Some healthcare providers do not accept patients with certain plans like Medicaid or Medicare, so depending on your insurance it may take some trial-and-error to find a provider. If you do not have insurance, speak to the clinic or health system's billing department for a cost estimate, and inquire about self-pay discounts, financial assistance programs, or repayment plans.
