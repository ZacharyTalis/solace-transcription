# GAHT/HRT (Testosterone)
This can be an intimidating process, but I've got you covered.  
NOTE: Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is a term which more accurately describes the use of hormones by the trans community versus hormone replacement therapy (HRT). You may encounter both terms interchangeably when seeking out gender-affirming care, but this resource uses GAHT as the more current and medically-accurate term.  
For patients seeking to begin GAHT, a small but growing number of informed consent (IC) clinics allow patients to start treatment without the requirements discussed below. Typically, this entails an office visit to discuss treatment options and effects, and determine that the patient is able to provide informed consent for treatment. A link to a map of known IC clinics (credit to ShareBlue digital director Erin Reed) can be found here: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&ll=46.1509178489253%2C-115.16746627527243&z=7](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&ll=46.1509178489253%2C-115.16746627527243&z=7).  
Aside from this option, most other physicians in the US and worldwide follow the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care (SOC). Their criteria for beginning GAHT are listed below:

> Persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria  
> Capacity to make a fully informed decision and to consent to treatment  
> Age of majority in a given country  
> If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well-controlled.

Assessment for these criteria must be done by a qualified health professional, either a mental health professional like a therapist, or, if they are qualified to perform this assessment, a hormone provider (some primary care providers can do this, otherwise this would be a specialist like an endocrinologist). If a mental health professional completes the assessment, they must be the one to refer you to the provider for GAHT. If you are being referred by a therapist for treatment, they may be able to assist with connecting you to a provider. A primary care physician (PCP) may not be able to complete the assessment or start treatment themselves, but can also initiate a specialist referral to a healthcare provider who can. Otherwise, a search engine inquiry for "[city name] hormone therapy" will also give you a starting point in terms of who in your area offers those services.  
The goal of masculinizing GAHT is to reduce the body's level of estrogen or estradiol and increase testosterone in order to promote physical changes in the body. The prescription, dosage, and method of delivery will depend on your desired outcome from treatment (full masculinization vs. androgynous presentation), so it is critical to be open and direct with your healthcare provider regarding your goals so they can prescribe appropriately.  
Testosterone is typically taken as an injection, as a topical gel or patch, or as an implant. While everyone is different, typical outcomes with GAHT includes balding and voice changes, acne, increased and coarser facial hair and body, change in distribution of body fat, enlargement of some genital parts, stop to monthly bleeding, and increased muscle mass. Some of the risks of beginning GAHT include increased blood pressure, higher cholesterol and triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol and triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol, increased red blood cell count, and sleep apnea, and increased risk for severe birth defects during pregnancy.  
Costs can vary depending on the clinic, prescribed treatment, and patient's insurance coverage. With a GoodRx coupon, testosterone generally costs between $12 to $60 a month, depending on your dose and route. For patients with insurance, make sure that the endocrinologist is in network for your plan (this can be verified by calling your insurance, or most have a provider lookup tool on their website for members). If possible, see if the clinic can give you a quote or even the procedure codes that they bill under. The bulk of your costs will fall under specialty office visits and prescription coverage, so be sure to verify your coverage level for these services. Some healthcare providers do not accept patients with certain plans like Medicaid or Medicare, so depending on your insurance it may take some trial-and-error to find a provider. If you do not have insurance, speak to the clinic or health system's billing department for a cost estimate, and inquire about self-pay discounts, financial assistance programs, or repayment plans.
