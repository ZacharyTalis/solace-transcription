# GAHT/HRT via Plume
I made a friend! They're called Plume! And they've arrived in [state name].  
Solace and Plume have partnered to make gender affirming care more accessible. Plume's specialty is Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) or as they call it, Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy (GAHT).  
Plume ([www.Plume.LGBT](www.Plume.LGBT)) is a first-of-its-kind telehealth company for the transgender community which provides you with nearly everything you need to start, continue, and maintain your gender-affirming hormone therapy from your smartphone. Plume is led by trans folks, and they are on a mission to obliterate the gatekeeping that can make the journey of transition needlessly difficult.  
Right off the top, Plume is a separate service outside of your insurance or other traditional healthcare systems. Their private service has a $99/month fee but has the benefits of not needing to wrangle with your insurance, dealing with unqualified medical provider, seeking out insensitive mental health professionals, and the like that comes with starting GAHT. Even if you currently have a provider GAHT but are unsatisfied with the level of care you are receiving, this represents a way to circumnavigate that system.  
Plume's membership includes the following:

> Prescriptions for gender-affirming medications as needed sent to the pharmacy of your choice.  
> Letters for name or gender marker change or surgery.  
> Ordering, analysis, and cost all labs.  
> Direct access to your medical care team who specialize in gender-affirming care.  
> 24/7 text access to your care team and response within an hour during business hours, M-F 9AM-5PM MST.  
> Digital video appointments from anywhere.  
> Your care team will track your progress with quarterly evaluations and adjust treatment as needed.

[Caution symbol] At this time, the cost of your prescriptions are not included in the membership fee, and can add $5-$50/month on average to your cost.  
Plume offers its members a way to receive access to high-quality care for their transition, and do so in the comfort of their own home.
