# Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria
Getting a medical diagnosis is the first step to being able to access many medical options. I'll help you get started.  
Gender dysphoria is a medical condition defined by the American Psychiatric Association as a "conflict between a person's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which he/he/they identify."1 Specific symptoms can vary depending on the individual, buy many people diagnosed with dysphoria experience significant distress and/or problems functioning as a result of this internal conflict, and experience relief by socially or medically transitioning their external appearance to be reflective of their true selves.  
While many of their lifestyle changes associated with socially transitioning can be taken with or without a diagnosis, a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria is an important first step for many of the legal and medical steps associated with gender transition. Typically, gender dysphoria is diagnosed by a therapist or mental health professional, who will write a letter for the patient's records that they can furnish confirming the diagnosis. The criteria for this diagnosis are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and differ depending on the age of the patient.  
For adolescents and adults, patients must experience at least two of the below symptoms for 6 months or longer:

1. A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics  
2. A strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics  
3. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender  
4. A strong desire to be of the other gender  
5. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender  
6. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender  

For children, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria requires at least six of the following symptoms, with associated significant distress or impairment of function, for 6 months or longer:

1. A strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other gender  
2. A strong preference for wearing clothes typical of the opposite gender  
3. A strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe play or fantasy play  
4. A strong preference for the toys, games or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other gender  
5. A strong preference for playmates of the other gender  
6. A strong rejection of toys, games and activities typical of one's assigned gender
7. A strong dislike of one's sexual anatomy  
8. A strong desire for the physical sex characteristics that match one's experienced gender
